Ok, I'd like to put all package info into the Lackey plugin, to enable Sealed Deck, draft tournaments, and so on, via Lackey. So I'm reposting the main list in here again, to be able to update it with the latest info. Many thanks to all who have contributed to all the information! Still some missing though, so if anyone has more information (including checking the current info), don't hesitate to post. 

Green = Completed information.
Black = Not completed info, missing information.
Red = Contradicting information.
