        Basically this version is very incomplete. I usually
        wouldn't release something at this stage, but I'm afraid
        I won't be getting much more work done on it for a while
        and a number of GDCers have requested to see how this
        program is coming a long.

        It only really supports Personnel and regular Verb type
        cards. I havn't removed the other card types from the
        program, as the basic graphics do work. For the time being,
        you can set all text fields to empty, save them as 100%
        quality JPEGs, and add the text using a image editing
        program.
