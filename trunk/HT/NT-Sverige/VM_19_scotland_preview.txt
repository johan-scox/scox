The match against Scotland is indeed a classic battle, which has a long history, and this game is certainly one of the more challenging ones for Sweden this Qualification. Fortunately I have a quite good knowledge of Scotland having been there many times, and also having spies, no sorry, I meant family of course, who has lived in Edinburgh for many years. I have just finished my scouting (i.e. delivered a certain brown thing to a city south of here), and I am confident that this "tactic" will ensure us a victory tonight. The Swedish spirit is strong as always, and we are at good form, both within the squad, and the many eager prospects just outside the squad waiting to get a chance to prove themslef in the mighty Swedish team. We are confident we will walk away from this battle even more victorious and stronger than before.
