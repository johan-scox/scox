[b][u]U20-Nigeria requirements:[/u][/b]

As a small country in the Hattrick world our demands for players to be eligible for our U20 squad is not that high. Generally though, to be subject to consideration for the squad, the player has to be in training at the moment, should be 17-19 years old and should preferably be planned to be in training for this season and the next. Specialties will be considered a plus if of the right kind for that type of player, but the player’s main skill and side-skills are almost always weighed considerably higher. Specialties could therefore be the difference in case there are many similar players competing for the same spot. 

These are the requirement of the different player types:

[b]Goalkeepers:[/b]
We are in dire need of a goalkeeper for the next WC qualification, and therefore practically any goalkeeper that is passable or better at the moment (and in training of course) has a chance of making the team.

[b]Defenders:[/b]
Excellent defenders has a very good chance to make the squad, especially if they have some amount of passing or a suitable specialty, for instance passing and unpredictable, high on set pieces or head. Solid defenders also has a good chance of making the squad, if the right side-skills and/or specialties are present, and even passable defenders may have a chance to make the squad as well, if side-skills and/or specialties are exceptionally good.

[b]Inner midfielders:[/b]
Around the same requirements as for defenders; excellent playmakers have very high chance of making the team, especially if they have passable or better stamina. High side-skills will of course increase the chance of making the team, as well as specialties, even if playmaking and side-skills will be valued highest. Good specialties include head and quick and technical, in order of importance, and to some extent powerful is also good. Solid also playmakers have a good chance of making the squad if they have good side-skills and/or specialties. Passable playmakers will probably not be considered, if they are not high in their playmaking and have exceptionally good stamina and side-skills and/or specialties. Generally, passable stamina or better is preferred, but at least inadequate stamina is required, if lower the player should receive some stamina training to increase his chances to make the squad.

[b]Wingers:[/b]
Excellent wingers have a chance to make the squad, especially if they have some amount of playmaking, passing and/or scoring, in order of importance. Quick wingers will be valued the highest, but technical, unpredictable and head are also good specialties that will increase the player’s chances to make the team. No wingers below excellent are considered at the moment, unless they are exceptionally good at their side-skills.

[b]Forwards:[/b]
Excellent scorers or better have very high chance to make the squad, regardless of side-skills. Solid scorers have a chance to make the squad if they have some amount of passing, but winger, stamina and/or specialties could also be considers if there is a close call between several candidates, so any of these could increase a players chances of making the team. Good specialties include quick, unpredictable, head and technical, in order of importance.

[b]Coach:[/b]
We're looking for a Nigerian player with solid leadership abilities that will be converted into a coach during the following week, or has just been converted.

[b]Set pieces:[/b]
On any player, a high level of set pieces will reduce the requirement of the main skill of that player, since we're looking for a good player with set pieces to join the squad, if set pieces and main skill is sufficiently high. If you think that you have such a player, don't hesitate to contact us.
