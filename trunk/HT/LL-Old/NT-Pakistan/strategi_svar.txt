Hi all,

I'm on vacation, and writing this from my summerplace via mobile, so I'll be short. :o) 

I think I should elaborate a little on your question here, this text should really be 4-5 forwards, because you always want to keep the opponent from "knowing" that you wont play a certain formation or tactic, and having as many available formations, and in good form, is very important. Generally witout any preferences of teams and such I'd say the numbers for the squad should be 2-3 goalkeepers, 5-8 defenders, 6-10 midfielders, 2-5 wingers and 3-6 forwards. But, again, that depends on the players available and the expected opponents.

We'll start the qualification with a few open spots, therefor we can always add another player if it seems necessary, but we'll probably fill them rather soon, after a couple of weeks, since we would like the maximum number of players to receive salary reduction (i.e. motivated trainers). Without knowing the squad too good yet, I'll assume that we have an infinite number of equally good players and specialities, and select from them. ;o) Then I would choose, for a squad of 25, 3 goalkeepers, 7 defenders, 7 midfielders, 3 wingers and 5 forwards. Initially we will probebly skip one goalkeeper, one defender and one forward, hence leaving three open spots. The main problem is probably "only" 7 midfielders, it can be troublesome to get maximized midfield with "only" 7 inner-mids, but we'll see how the squad will look like depending on the current squad, and most importantly the qualification group.
