Regarding penalty takers, number one is of course the same player who takes the set pieces, which is the guy with the highest set pieces skill in the team (including "normal" boosts for form and experience). The rest of the guys are weighted a little bit differently, since set pieces, scoring, experience and technical speciality are weighted together when the match engine decides if the player scores or not. I usually sum scoring and set pieces together to make an initial ranking of the players, ranking set pieces a little bit higher than scoring though, if the sums are similar. Then I adjust the list depending on the experience of the players, a player with high experience will go berfore an unexperinced player with sevaral more stept higher sum. The same with a technical player, even though experience is more important then technincal speciality.

All this will not be relevant until we reach the semi-finals in two seasons of course, since the rest of the matches are group stage matches. ;o)
