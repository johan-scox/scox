Hi all, 

My name is Johan Skoglund and I am 28 years old. I live in Göteborg in Sweden and work at a Japanese electronics company as a software engineer. I have been playing Hattrick since New Years Day 2002, so almost 5 years, or 16 seasons to measure it in real (Hattrick) time. ;o) I play in level 4 in Sweden, so I have good experience playing with and against teams with similar players as is relevant in the NT’s. My league is ranked 10th in Sweden actually, so my league level might be a little misleading. ;o) I am also used to being an underdog; I have for instance placed 2nd and 3rd in the series two seasons, despite having the team with the least TSI, and the lowest wages. Last season I finished 4th, but I have changed training mid-season, which impacted my performance in the series. I have during my Hattrick career been training defending, playmaking, passing, goalkeepers, scoring and right now wingers, so I have experience playing most line-ups. Counter-attacks is my specialty though, which I have been playing a lot, and I think it is an important tactic to master in U20/NT as well, since you can use your TS a lot more efficient then. 
I have also been assisting coach with Makkan with U20-Nigeria, a great experience, where we also placed higher in the Qualification than our player material was ranked. Also, since I have been working as an assistant coach for U20 with Makkan before, we have a good cooperation and well-defined tasks what we do between each other. I also liked the community part of the NT work; which I think is an important part of the NT responsibilities.
