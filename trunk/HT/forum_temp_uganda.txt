Ok, some long term and short term quick thoughts:

[u]Long term:[/u]
We have 7 formations with solid+ experience, I think we should concentrate on 5 of them or 6 at the most. To not be too easily read, and to be able to go offensive sometimes as well, I think both 352 and 451 are given. 

Since central attack is quite difficult in general in u20 to use, we need some strong central attack formations I think, especially since our strikers are not that good. Neither 343 or 253 are available now, so not really an option, but I think we should try to keep both 433 and 523 because of that. 442 is a good CA formation which can be done to gain some midfield (usually necessary), or to enable two really strong attacks wings (IMTW). Of the 3 available CA-formations, 523 is probably my least favorite, but I still think it is goof to have a CA formation with 5 defenders, to keep our options open. With 523, 433 and 442 we have a lot of options at least. 

Then we have 541 and 550 left then, of the once now available. I think 541 is best played as a "we'll loose anyway we might take a chance" - which in my view means CA, 5 defenders, balanced or defensive coach, FTW, off winger, IMTW, or possibly two side attacks with minimal midfield, same setup (FW, 2xOW, 2xIMtw). I.e. one crazystrong wing, or two fairly strong ones. 550 is also a viable option, but it depends more on strong midfield, combined with a set piece taker, since it is common to let at least one goal in, dpeending on how strong midfield one could get though, but initial look didn't made me very confident that we could compete on midfield very often, right?

So I think it is a matter of dropping 541 or 550. The lack of a really good set peice taker advocates for dropping 550 I think, but 550 is more oftenly useful if starting with 352 or 451. Having 3 CA formations already also makes 550 more attractive. On the other hand, starting with a CA formation, it is good to be able to go defensively if in the lead; from 433 or 523 one needs 3 subs (2 from 442) for the switch to 550, which is risky, with 541 as defensive option, you only need 2 (1 for 442). 

My conclusions is basically undecided at this point, but I just wanted to air my thoughts on the matter. :o)

[u]Short term:[/u]
First two matches we've seen quite a focus on one wing from our opponents, both in defense and offense. I think it is quite likely they will try to go offensively on one or two wings, and probably defend 1-2 of the wings heavily, since a xx1-formation is quite likely from our side. Based on that, and the formation experieces, I think we should go for 523 on Friday, to boost the experience, and to perhaps be able to score a goal or two in the middle + one of the wings, if they leave one of them "open". Two CD's should be TW to defend our wings the best we can, CD should be strong enough anyway. I'm thinking balanced coach would be best option then as well, maybe offensive even, since our poor self confidence, but that is purely gut feeling without calculations behind it. Subs should be set to go defensive fairly early if we're not down, or possibly even directly in a lead, but we might need to chose one of those options; the one in the lead is a bit more risky, since we might as well be down quite a bit. Minimizing goal difference is also good though, especially since SC should not be too shot, so maybe going defensively anyway around 55-60 minutes is an idea. 523 -> 541/550 then, depending on which one of them we chose to keep. PIC seems best option anyway this week, since we might want to 

Well, those are my initial thoughts
