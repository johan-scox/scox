Sorry guys, no tacitcal ananlysis this week, too much to do at work... :( Short ananlysis thought:

Panama always plays AOW, and have good wingers. They also always leave the same flank open in the defense. They have had some good results against the big teams, but it has been on thier homeground, so we should be able to gain possession, unless they play MOTS, which on the other hand is not impossible, since they have realy tough games away from home coming up the coming weeks, which they might see as lost either way.

Our squad looks quite good, Jumoh has finally found his form, solid form now, and Elsworth in the defense is also in solid form. The rest is not that good though, Udumego, second best, is in weak form. Midfield looks good, high form on all our best inners.  Offensively is our weakest point at the moment, best attacker Zubairu is still in weak form, and medium or low form on all other offensive players except winger Usman. Poor seld confidence also contributes to the fact that the offense is our weakest point right now. But we are still ok, we can still field an ok offenense with our current squad. And as I said, the team as a whole looks stronger than ever before in this qualification. Especially since we gotten our team spirit back to where it belongs... ;o)
