My name is Johan Skoglund, I am 28 years old, live in Gothenburg, Sweden, and work as a software engineer for a Japanese electronics company. I have had a team in Hattrick since New Years Day 2002, so a little bit over 4 years now, or pretty much exactly 14 seasons. I currently play in the fourth division in Sweden, were I ended up in second place last year, even though my team had the lower salary or all team, which I'm quite satisfied with. I currently train forwards, so my main tactics are 343 all-out and 433 counterattacks, even though basically everything in between those extreme tactic is played once in a while. ;) Before I have also trained goalies, passing, playmaking and defending. Next season I will start training wingers, both because it the only (main) training form I have not done, and it also fits into my long-term strategy well. I have greatly enjoyed my work with the Nigerian U20 team last term, as well as getting to know the Nigerian community a little better, and I would therefore like to continue this work. I will of course not leave the Nigerian community if we are not elected, but I just feel that we haven't gotten everything out of the Nigerian team yet, and there are still a lot to do both for the team and the community, especially that surrounding the Nigerian U20 team.

[b]Main goals[/b]
The main goal is to prepare the team for the next Qualification. This might seem as an obvious goal, since one should always do this, but this is to emphasis that this will have top priority this term, in means of trying to end up as high in the ranking as possible to have a chance for a better group next Qualification, maximizing players eligible for next Qualification experience and finally plan and "enforce" a better squad strategy for the U20 team.

[b]Tactics & squad[/b]
As we have hinted before, we plan to use 352, 343 and a yet not decided formation, which could be any of the remaining ordinary formations, since there is (will be) sufficient formations experience in all formations so that the particular tactic will be playable at the start of the WC Qualification. The last formation of course depends on the opponents in the group we end up in, but at the moment it looks like it will be 451 oe 541 that are most likely be elected as the third formation, both very strong defensive tactics. Both can be used to play CA as well, but only under extreme circumstances (i.e. against all-out teams), but when playing CA, 442 or 523 are the most likely formations that could be used. My (scox_) absolute favorite tactic is CA, so count on one or two CA matches, if there are any opportunities where it seems that just that might secure a victory, or when it looks like that might be the best, even though slim, chance to gain points from a favorite or two. ;)

The squad will probably look more or less as it does right now, even though 1-3 players will leave the squad before the team spirit reset, to keep an open door if drastic things happens to the current squad, i.e. if the situation requires it (injuries, special tactics, etc). We have not decided coach attitude (off/bal/def) yet, that will be determined depending on the Qualification group as soon as that it is decided. The best players will play in the competitive matches, to ensure best performance, i.e. Qualify as high as possible to improve the chances for next Qualification round. No more spots for younger players than the three 18 yo that are currently in the squad will be filled (unless they are better or close to their older competitors), to ensure best performance on the pitch, and not to compromise the squads flexibility towards different formations.

[b]Last term[/b]
Last term was an ok term for us in my eyes, but we can do better than that. Last Qualification we really had poor luck in the group draw, since we got Belgium, Germany & Rumania, all which have won medals at earlier WC's. The goals therefore became to end up in 4:th place, and the 4:th seeding group for this Qualification round. We didn't manage to end up in 4:th place, but the main goal was achieved, ending up in the fourth qualification seeding group, thanks to some nice wins towards the end of the qualification. Last season we played a friendly tournament amongst all ordinary friendlies, which went fairly well as well, even though we would have liked to go even further there. Maybe we could have dropped our three 20 year old's instead of keeping them another season (to be better for the NT) since they had rather good experience from the beginning, but they actually didn't played that many matches anyway. We finally had a period where we discussed tactics as well, but for various reasons we unfortunately lost track of that, something we regret, since we feel that we maybe lost some community involvement there.

[b]Changes and improvements[/b]
More activity in the community, more creative and more volume to the match and squad information, more tactic-talks, more clear strategy of squad and youth training (i.e. what to pull and train), more scouts, both player and opponent, more clear tactical strategy (because of last years experiences), and finally therefore also hopefully better results. ;)

[b]Other issues[/b]
Community activities, information, competitions, live-threads, tactic-talks in NSF.

[b]Summary[/b]

- Experience in both tactical issues and the running operations of the U20 team. 

- Clear tactical and strategical concept for the squad and U20-Nigeria as a whole.

- Plenty of improvements from last term.
